# args-generics

## status

Early draft.

## todos

- remove `undefined`s from code (and calls to `error`?)
- Implement error messages for unsupported types (e.g. sum types)
- implement --help
- look into simplifying constraints for users (shouldn't GHC.Generic be enough?)
- get rid of optparse-applicative
- implement support for short options
- implement automatic creation of short options
- implement commands (with sum types)
